# Hands-On examples of ABACUS.

This directory includes simple hands-on examples of ABACUS.

Four examples are included:
1. MgO_LCAO
2. MgO_PW
3. Si_LCAO
4. Si_PW

Each example includes three types of basic DFT calculation: SCF, optimization and 
electronic band structure. Si_PW is left empty deliberately for users' own exercise.

The file `Hands_On_Commands_ABC.md` collects the basic shell commands in running the
three examples in the `MgO_LCAO` directory. We assume the utilization of the
[Bohrium](https://bohrium.dp.tech/) platform to run these examples,
so the jobs are suggested to run under the /data directory.

A. SCF  
B. optimization  
C. band_structure
